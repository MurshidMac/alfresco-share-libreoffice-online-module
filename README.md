LibreOffice Edit Online Alfresco Share AMP module (V1)
========

## Introduction

This is an Alfresco Share AMP module that exposes the LibreOffice OnLine application client.<br/>
It adds a LibreOffice page to alfresco share wherein the LOOL client is loaded in an iframe.
It also adds a document library action button to document library views.<br/>
Works in conjunction with the repository AMP module (https://github.com/magenta-aps/libreoffice-online-repo).<br/>
This module was developed against Alfresco version 5.0.d and as such, works with the defaults Aikau version that ships with that version of Alfresco Share.
